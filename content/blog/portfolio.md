From the moment I started to learn code in 2024, I have been wanting to make a portfolio website. Well I did make some, but they all never looked good or was just plain html/css and i dont know it didnt have a character to it. I'm not saying right now there is, but I decided to try my best. So, I finally decided to build a **proper personal portfolio website**.

So here it is, i wanted a portfolio very simple that i dont really need to work too much on frontend because i hate it, but i gave it my best. I also wanted a blog page attached to it so i can write my thought process for my c++ projects or any other projects that i think is worth writing about. NGL, I thought this would be easy, but it clearly wasnt. I wouldnt say it was hard but its been a while since i did something in Next.js, so it took some time to process somethings.

## Problems i faced

- I didn’t know how to _read_ markdown files
- I didn’t know how to _extract_ data like title/date
- I didn’t know how to _render_ markdown as HTML
- I didn’t understand how _slugs_ work at all
- **OMG I CANT MAKE STYLE THIS MARKDOWN OMGG. I HATE FRONTEND BECAUSE OF THIS I HAVE BEEN ON THIS SHIT FOR 4 HOURS MY GOD**

## How I figured it out (GitHub saved me)

This repo — [nextjs-blog](https://github.com/sixfwa/nextjs-blog) — showed me how it works. This is one of the important lesson i learnt in this portflio to read codes, it really helps allot.

## Conclusion

This is just a starting file for now. I plan to write in detail blogs about C++ topics i learnt and struggled with. See you soon!
